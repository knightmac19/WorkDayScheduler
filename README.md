# WorkDayScheduler

## Description 

Time is a scarce resource, and organizing tasks helps people be more productive when it's time to be productive and allows people the mental space to relax when it's time to relax. A good workday scheduler allows the user to create their own list of tasks, block those tasks according to time, and update the style of the list as the day progresses. 

This application provides users with that functionality. A sticky header displays the current date and time, including a second-ticker. The application allows users to write up their own tasks, and save the data so it's available after the browser is refreshed. Depending on the current time, rows are conditionally formatted so the user can distinguish between past, present, and future to-do's. For example: if the current time is 10AM then the input field for the 10AM row will have a background of gray, the previous row (9AM) will have a background of red, while the rest of the rows' input fields will have green backgrounds.
