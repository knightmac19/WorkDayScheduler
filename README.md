## Description 

Time is a scarce resource, and organizing tasks helps people be more productive. A good workday scheduler allows the user to create their own list of tasks, block those tasks according to time, and dynamically updates the style of the list as time passes. This application gives users a simple and reliable appointment/to-do scheduler.

A sticky header displays the current date and time, including a second-ticker. The application allows users to write up their own tasks or appointments. The application saves user data so it's available after the browser is refreshed. Data can be deleted with a "Clear Row" button. Depending on the current time, rows are conditionally formatted so the user can distinguish between past, present, and future items. For example: if the current time is 10AM then the input field for the 10AM row will have a background of gray, the previous row (9AM) will have a background of red, while the future input fields will have green backgrounds.
